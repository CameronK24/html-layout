                *Sigh* I can't believe I have to make this video... *insert pet for sympathy points* I have let not only myself, but all of my fans that watch my videos and the world down with my actions. I should never have said I was a Luigi main in Smash Bro's 2 projects back. I am in fact, a Samus/Young Link main. Yes, I spam projectiles and camp, but how else am I supposed to play those characters? I just thought maybe I could get less backlash by pretending to be a Luigi main. I am extremely sorry and I will never claim to be a main of something I am not anymore. I will embrace my Young Link maining self from now on.
